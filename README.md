# Migration

Example project in SwiftUI, the functions are followed the [Stanford CS193p videos by Paul Hegarty](https://www.youtube.com/user/StanfordUniversity/videos) step by step. And I added the unit tests and ui tests in the project also, wish help.

I'll try to do migrates Story Boards in this project in future.

Any suggestions are welcome, thanks.
